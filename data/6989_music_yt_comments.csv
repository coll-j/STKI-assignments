1639,Taylor Swift - Red (Taylor's Version) (Lyric Video) - YouTube,"red reminds me of my happy crush since when i was in 4th grade. IDK WHY, this just reminds me of him. like LOVING HIM WAS RED but when we separated ways, it felt like ""LOSING HIM WAS BLUE LIKE I'D NEVER KOWN,"" and i thought i wont miss him since he's just a happy crush before and ""MISSING HIM WAS DARK GRAY ALL ALONE."" i remember i confessed my feelings to him before and it went well, we're like best of friends with that little ""butterflies"" until we separated ways when he turned high school since hes a yr older than me but then i went to the same school after a year and we interacted again but not like before since we became both busy. and now, taylor released this new album and decided to sendthim a message (that he's most likely not to get since he's not that active on socmed) bc he keeps on running in my mind again just like before everytime i listen to taylor's songs. there's a part of me that is embarrassed with my message but im also hoping that i get the closure that I'm wishing for. it's just kinda... sad. "" losing him was blue like I'd never known."" THIS JUST HITS DIFFERENT. I MEAN-- IT'S LIKE I CAN RELATE TO EVERY SONG OF TAYLOR and HE'S THE ONE I KEEP ON THINKING ABT WHILE LISTENING"

2510,Taylor Swift - Red (Taylor's Version) (Lyric Video) - YouTube,"Beautiful. So powerful. We‚Äôre looking at a gal that can take a sad song and weave through it with outstanding command. The best part is how it hits all people differently, some sad and all others energized happy. By my book the messenger and music seen here should very well set the tone of americas future from this day forward. It‚Äôs clean, appeals to ages 0 to 99, and is so unifying powerful and reminiscent of bygone days when all understood the country,  Final summary from these eyes is we‚Äôve never met, but in reality she feels like someone I grew up with in grade school 50 years ago and sends a very positive pro American message. I love it."

3696,Taylor Swift - I Knew You Were Trouble (Taylor's Version) (Lyric Video) - YouTube,"What I like about this version is that is cleaner and sounds a little softer and more mature. You can tell she was going through the lyrics thinking ""damn I was hurt back then"" but leaving the feelings behind.

I prefer the emotions on the previous one tho. The way she was able to project the anger and pain she was feeling coming out of a toxic relationship was major. You could feel how raw the emotions were at the time of recording the song."

I was only seven when I first heard this album, but songs like I Almost Do and Begin Again changed everything I knew about country music.  I've listened to a lot of songs over the years, but this is still one of my all-time favorites."
3702,Taylor Swift - I Knew You Were Trouble (Taylor's Version) (Lyric Video) - YouTube,"I feel like a teenager again listening this album haha. So much memories. Her voice sounds more mature, and like some comments said you don't feel the same angust that she used to put before.

3722,Taylor Swift - I Knew You Were Trouble (Taylor's Version) (Lyric Video) - YouTube,"After listening to the old version, i went here to listen with the new one. And i somehow realised that Taylor Swift's voice got even matured here in the new version. If i would compare and contrast them, I think the older one made me feel the hatred and the feeling of melancholy after she broke up with her past lover, while the new ones made me even feel that she already have had moved on yet as she looks back from the past, her scars are still there and it left wounds that she knew it will always be part of her. Overall i truly admired Taylor's voice and the way she told a story of her that was like long written before in an old diary of her past. She is truly Incredible! ‚ù§"
3723,Taylor Swift - I Knew You Were Trouble (Taylor's Version) (Lyric Video) - YouTube,Is it just me or does the version sound more stripped and clean than the original? I'm actually loving the vibe

5309,"Lady Gaga, Bradley Cooper - Shallow (from A Star Is Born) (Official Music Video) - YouTube","This was definitely ""A Star is Born"" for the new generation.  Apparently, a generation that won't get it unless it's blasted in their face,  requiring actors to act without any  nuance, subtley or creativity.   As a result the masses loved it.   But unfortunately to the experienced , mature, educated movie goer it was really bad.   The whole movie was too cliche, heavy handed, over the top and try hard.  The line between brilliant acting and bad is so thin.  It requires a director to pull back actors at certain times, leaving creative room for the audience to respond.   None of that happened in this movie.   This movie really suffered from the vanity of an actor/director trying to do all and be all and yet there are several actors out there who would have nailed this role.   Instead of finding an actor with a the right voice, Bradley attempts to change his and it came off as exactly that.  Instead of finding an actor who could play the guitar, he has to learn how to play it himself and comes off as exactly that.  After you go through what he went through to ""become"" this role and then he's ALSO the director?   After all that work and sacrifice, if that same guy is the director, human nature prevents the best choices in how to depict it on film.   As a result it was ""look how fantastic Bradley is"" in every scene.   Meanwhile the character himself isn't all that fantastic.  The audience won't believe you and for those who view film with a nuanced eye, they didn't.     Bradley should have owned his role as a star or as a director but since the role was so far and away of who Bradley really is, it just didn't work.   It came off a try-hard vanity project.   One Star.    PS - even rock stars wash their hair every now and then and what was with the ""sun burndt"" look througout the entire movie?   It was just cute boy Bradley Cooper trying hard to look like the rough, gruff rock star/alcoholic.   People tended to compare Bradley with Meryl Streep in this role saying he ""Meryled"" it.  First of all if someone says you ""Meryled"" it and is comparing you to someone else, you didn't really do what they say you did.  Rather, you looked like you tried really hard at it.  When Streep does a role there is no sense that she's trying hard to do it, that's the unspeakable quality she has.  She just does it and it comes off without any effort, totally natural - a rare gift for any actor and she's directed by people who know how to show it, rather than focusing on it, resulting in an amazing, believable film."

5771,"Lady Gaga, Bradley Cooper - Shallow (from A Star Is Born) (Official Music Video) - YouTube","I am not a Bradley Copper or Lady GaGa fan but I wanted to see what all the hype was about. I am a Led Zeppelin, Al Pacino type of guy but went to go see this movie and while trying to fight back the tears I began wondering why I was so sensitive to this film and  realized Its about all of us. The beauty of beginning to fall in love,  Being in love,  That love begin to be threatened for whatever reason and suddenly things begin and cracks appear and our feet begin hitting the ground again ( love )  We yearn to feel it again and reminisce what we once had and we want the 2 hearts that beat as one to be whole again to the time we lifted each other up and completed one another.  These are some of the many thoughts I felt while watching this. It is the story of all our lives,  Being  a star in the one you love's eyes is much more powerful than being a star through Millions of eyes. If the one you love and cherish and the one that makes you feel complete begins to slip and fall you feel as if everything has come unglued.   My apologies for babbling but these are the many thoughts and emotions I felt watching this movie and then thinking about my own experiences with falling in love.  It was so real life this movie and yes,  I cried and more than once and you know what? For some strange reason I feel as If some untapped love and untapped hurt poured out of me from my experiences in life and if my tears from this movie were transferred to film, I would see the moments that conjured those feelings from my own life that brought me to tears. This movie was real life,  Now, Me being single and alone makes all of the feeling I felt from this movie more beautiful even if they hurt and even if I had to re live some of my life all over again LOVE was all worth it.   - Paul in Massachusetts"

6536,"Lady Gaga, Bradley Cooper - Shallow (from A Star Is Born) (Official Music Video) - YouTube",2:46 was the first bit I heard of this song in the trailer for the film. It's also my favourite bit in the whole song: just the power behind the end of the song there. Kind of makes it weird to think this song starts out so chilled and relaxed.

Just her, her music and her natural beauty and talent....many of you may not agree with me but like I said, it's just my opinion...."

6554,"Lady Gaga, Bradley Cooper - Shallow (from A Star Is Born) (Official Music Video) - YouTube","The videos from her first couple hits were pretty extreme as far as establishing her style visually. It always threw me off though because it was one of those things where you could tell a lot of effort was put into a sort of artificial look. When I saw her I didn't feel like I was actually seeing her. Like the unfortunate girls in high school that look horribly different without their makeup. Her documentary touched on it to an extent, her insecurities about her nose and looks. Personally I think she is gorgeous. The human chemistry, mannerisms, and everything about this is amazing. Like a glimpse of her, another layer of character, a side she's not shared in this way before (movies). Idk..... I didn't appreciate her for a couple of years at the beginning of her career, thought she was a typical untalented pop artist that will dissappear. I love being wrong in these circumstances. I particularly love that she is taking a pretty extreme break off of her typical genre. Flexing her muscles and saying ""you even lift bro? "" to people who doubt."

When Bradley‚Äôs character (Jack)  looks at Gaga‚Äôs character (Ally) he looks genuinely proud of her when she came up on the stage finally. I think he really is. He fought for Gaga to get this part because he believed in her acting. She believes in him as a singer. This pride for each other is genuine. What we see in a trailer or in this music video isn‚Äôt acting...it‚Äôs two people legitimizing the other and having complete faith in each other. If a music video and a couple trailers can move me this much, I can‚Äôt wait for the movie. I‚Äôve never felt this way about a movie before, ever.
